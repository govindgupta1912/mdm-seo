//     question: " What is MobiHeal MDM?",
//     answer: "MDM is a type of security software that enables IT administrators to control, secure, and enforce policies on employee smartphones, tablets, and other devices. It allows organizations to ensure that corporate data is protected, regardless of where the device is located."
//   },
//   {
//     category: "general",
//     question: "How does SecureMDM protect corporate data?",
//     answer: "SecureMDM protects corporate data through multiple layers of security, including device encryption, application management, secure containers, data loss prevention policies, and remote wipe capabilities. These features ensure sensitive information remains protected, even if a device is lost or stolen."
//   },
//   {
//     category: "general",
//     question: "Can I manage both iOS and Android devices?",
//     answer: "Yes, SecureMDM provides comprehensive support for both iOS and Android devices, allowing you to manage your entire fleet from a single console regardless of operating system. Our platform also supports Windows and macOS devices for complete endpoint management."

//   // Features FAQs
//   {
//     category: "features",
//     question: "What is the difference between BYOD and corporate-owned device management?",
//     answer: "BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) management focuses on separating work and personal data on employee-owned devices through containerization, ensuring corporate security without compromising user privacy. Corporate-owned device management provides more comprehensive control over company-owned devices, with full management of device settings, applications, and security policies."
//   },
//   {
//     category: "features",
//     question: "What is Kiosk Mode and how does it work?",
//     answer: "Kiosk Mode allows you to lock down a device to run only specific applications, preventing users from accessing other features or settings. This is ideal for customer-facing deployments, such as in retail, hospitality, or healthcare settings. You can configure devices to run in single-app or multi-app mode with customized branding and settings."
//   },
//   {
//     category: "features",
//     question: "How does Remote Lock & Wipe work?",
//     answer: "Remote Lock allows administrators to instantly lock a lost or stolen device to prevent unauthorized access. Remote Wipe goes further by completely erasing all data from the device or selectively wiping only corporate data. These actions can be triggered from the admin console as soon as a device is reported lost or stolen."
//   },
  
//   // Security FAQs
//   {
//     category: "security",
