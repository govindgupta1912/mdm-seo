You can configure devices to run in single-app or multi-app mode with customized branding and settings."
//   },
//   {
//     category: "features",
//     question: "How does Remote Lock & Wipe work?",
//     answer: "Remote Lock allows administrators to instantly lock a lost or stolen device to prevent unauthorized access.
